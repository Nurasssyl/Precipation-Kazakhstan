# Precipation-Kazakhstan

![](111.jpeg)

I made a precipitation map of Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 

I developed this visualization using the R programming language using the libraries: recipe, is car, terra, tidyverse, rayshader, sf, classintimdevky

Conclusions from the map:

1. The northeastern and southeastern regions of Kazakhstan receive more precipitation. 🌧️

2. The central and southern regions of the country receive less precipitation. 🏜️

3. Green areas indicate a more humid climate, typical for mountainous and foothill areas (Altai, Alatau, Tien Shan). ⛰️

4. Pink and beige areas indicate a more arid climate typical of steppes and deserts. (for example: Mangystau, Kyzylorda)🌾

5. Low precipitation levels are observed in the western part of Kazakhstan, especially closer to the Caspian Sea. 🌊
